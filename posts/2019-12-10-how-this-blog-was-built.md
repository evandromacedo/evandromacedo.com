First, the repository of this blog is [open-source](https://github.com/evandromacedo/evandromacedo.com), so you can explore the code for the things described here. Second, this stack is fully inspired in [Willian Justen's stack](https://willianjusten.com.br/making-of-blog-novo/). If you understand portuguese and want to learn all these techs, [he has an entire course](https://www.udemy.com/course/gatsby-crie-um-site-pwa-com-react-graphql-e-netlify-cms/?ranMID=39197&ranEAID=16ht5juwidA&ranSiteID=16ht5juwidA-iL5YMJd.vOOyQpz3pyqUhw&LSNPUBID=16ht5juwidA) about this.

## The design

Before I talk about code, I'll briefly talk about the design. First of all, the general UI of this blog was inspired by a newspaper layout:

![Newspaper](/newspaper.jpg)

The whole design was made using [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/). I usually do this steps when I'm building some layout:

1. Do some research to find what I want.
1. Create a wireframe for mobile and desktop.
1. Create a _Styleguide_ page and...
1. Define the color pallet that will be used in light and dark mode.
1. Define the typography and the styles (like headline, subtitle, body, caption, etc.).
1. Create an _Assets_ page and put everything that will be used there, like backgrounds and icons.
1. Create a layout for mobile with less than 480px, then will expanding 'till desktop layout.

## Gatsby

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a powerful framework for generating static sites. It uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) as front-end library, and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to consume content and assets. To better understand what Gatsby does:

- First it pulls data from many data sources (CMSs, Markdown, APIs, etc.) with GraphQL.
- With data in hands, we create components and templates with React.
- When the work is done, Gatsby builds everything into static HTML, CSS and JS files.
- With static files you can deploy your site easily on dozens of services. Gatsby now has its own [Gatsby Cloud service](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud/).

Gatsby does a great work on performance, loading only the critical content and prefetching data for internal links. It is also very safe because everything is static, so you won't have any trouble with things like _SQL Injection_. And the main advantage of Gatsby is that you are working with cutting edge technologies which causes an awesome _developer experience_. Other than that, it has an excellent documentation and great community, so almost every problem you have probably was solved by someone.

The framework uses a pluggable ecosystem and [there is a plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/) for everything you want. Below are some plugins I used:

### Gatsby Image

[gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/) provides a complete image optimization for your application, from image processing to advanced loading techniques. Among all the features, the ones that I like the most are the image resizing according to the device, lazy loading, and the _blur-up_ technique that shows a preview of the image while it loads.

### Markdown and PrismJS

I use Markdown to write the posts of this blog. The [gatsby-transformer-remark](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/) plugin parses all Markdown files and makes them available on GraphQL for you to use on your components.

To add syntax highlighting to posts' code blocks, I use PrismJS with the [gatsby-remark-prismjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-prismjs/) plugin.

### PWA

The [default Gatsby starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) comes with two plugins that handles all PWA stuff for you:

- [gatsby-plugin-manifest](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-manifest/): generates the web app manifest.
- [gatsby-plugin-offline](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-offline/): creates a service worker and loads it into the client.

With these 2 plugins you turn you site into a PWA with literally some lines of JSON configurations.

### Google Analytics and Sitemap

[gatsby-plugin-google-analytics](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-google-analytics/) inserts the Google Analytics script in your application. And the [gatsby-plugin-sitemap](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-sitemap/) creates a `/sitemap.xml` file when your site is running in production mode.

## Styled Components

Styled Components is the most popular CSS-in-JS library out there. It uses tagged template literals to style your React components and generates unique class names so you don't have to worry about CSS conflicts. I use [Kitze's](https://twitter.com/thekitze) way of importing Styled Components under the `S.` namespace:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Experimenting with something.

### styled-media-query

I aaalways forget the CSS syntax for media queries, so I use the [styled-media-query](https://github.com/morajabi/styled-media-query)'s beautiful methods like `lessThan(breakpoint)`. I also use `generateMedia()` to standardize the CSS breakpoints in one place and reuse elsewhere. I use the common `large`, `medium` and `small` breakpoints for general styles, but I also like to set specific breakpoints for some components. I believe that some components need more flexibility on breakpoints to deliver the better responsiveness as possible. So I define breakpoints like these ones:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
import { generateMedia } from 'styled-media-query'

const mediaQuery = generateMedia({
  large: '1170px',
  medium: '768px',
  small: '480px',
  header: '848px',
  socialLinks: '960px',
  mastheadInfo: '416px',
  paginationText: '360px'
})

export default mediaQuery
```

And in the Styled Components I use them this way:

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components'
import mediaQuery from '../../styles/mediaQuery'

export const SocialLinksList = styled.ul`
  display: grid;
  grid-gap: 0.8rem;
  grid-auto-flow: column;
  grid-auto-columns: 3.2rem;
  align-items: center;
  list-style: none;

  ${mediaQuery.lessThan('socialLinks')`
    grid-auto-flow: row;
  `}
`
```
